# Diverse representation

Technology has the power to drive action. And right now, a call to action is needed to eradicate racism. **Black lives matter.**

We recognize technology alone cannot fix hundreds of years of racial injustice and inequality, but when we put it in the hands of the Black community and their supporters, technology can begin to bridge a gap. To start a dialogue. To identify areas where technology can help pave a road to progress.

This project is an effort to leverage technology to prevent, detect, and remediate bias and misrepresentation in the workplace, products, and society. For corporations to succeed, it is critical to have Black representation at every level.

This is one of three open source projects underway as part of the [Call for Code Emb(race) Spot Challenge](https://github.com/topics/embrace-call-for-code) led by contributors from IBM and Red Hat.

### Overview

#### What's the problem?

The global climate crisis is inextricably linked to water. Higher temperatures and more extreme weather events are projected to affect the availability and distribution of rainfall, snowmelt, river flows, and groundwater, and further deteriorate water quality. Low-income communities, already the most vulnerable to any threats to water supply, are likely to be the worst affected.

Read the [UN policy on climate change and water](https://www.unwater.org/publications/un-water-policy-brief-on-climate-change-and-water/) and understand how you can make a difference.

#### How can technology help?

Whether it's third-party open source projects or IBM Cloud services, technologies like data analytics, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and blockchain can help address global environmental challenges such as water quantity and quality. Using water more efficiently will reduce greenhouse gases from treatment systems.

## Envision

### The idea

The team tackled the challenges that come in the process of rebuilding after the impact of a disaster. Research has shown that rapid yet well-informed and well-orchestrated rebuilding measures can help to massively reduce the negative impact of disasters on the life, well-being, and health of individuals. An effective and efficient system of accessing information and contributing feedback in a way that can improve the foundation of future decisions is key to this cycle.

In order to leverage the benefits of such a system it must be designed to allow for simple ingestion of information, data, images along with a user-friendly way of drawing insights from it. The team created a platform-based solution that aggregates and analyzes historical and current data related to infrastructure, agriculture, weather, utility and more. It can then be used to derive key insights for future response and reconstruction plans. 

### How it works

The goal of this solution is to provide a better feedback loop that empowers local municipalities, small business owners, and members of the community, especially the most vulnerable. The team approached this problem by looking how a solution could benefit three potential end users who need access to information about the current situation, resources available to them, and how to better prepare next time:

1. A disaster victim, who seeks information on how to improve her community by best matching her skills to volunteer opportunities.
1. A small business owner who needs to open her shop as soon as possible to restart cash flow.
1. A local elected government official, who needs to generate damage assessments and rebuilding recommendations quickly.

By combining cloud-native infrastructure with event-driven data processing and intelligent modeling, this solution could help predict when and where a disaster may strike next and extrapolate the impact. Furthermore, it could allow stakeholders to derive the most promising course of action with the greatest improvement to plans and processes possible.

### Diagrams

This solution starter idea combines machine learning models with real-time information to get users the information they need to take action quickly.

1. By managing a collection of models about how better to restore infrastructure, the system could store historical data, use that to predict trends, and therefore provide recommendations in the form of an assessment.
1. These models could then be referenced by various applications to collect information about the current situation and provide end users with the assessments.
1. By rating the success of the recommendation, users can provide information that will help others in turn during future situations to build back better.

### Contribute

#### Contributing

This solution starter kit has been initiated by a core leadership team during a Design Thinking session in June 2020, but it is intended to be a collaborative effort to bring technology to bear on an area where it can make an immediate and lasting impact.

As part of the Call for Code Emb(race) Challenge, we call on the the IBM and Red Hat community to guide the future of this solution towards an open source project that can be put into use at IBM and made available to the larger world.

Contribution details are in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) document. Common questions are in the [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) file. But in a nutshell, you can contribute by opening issues to spark discussions, open pull requests to submit code or documentation changes, or create pages in the wiki.
