# Emb(race): Police and Judicial Reform and Accountability

Technology has the power to drive action. And right now, a call to action is
 needed to eradicate racism. **Black lives matter.**

We recognize technology alone cannot fix hundreds of years of racial injustice
 and inequality, but when we put it in the hands of the Black community and
 their supporters, technology can begin to bridge a gap. To start a dialogue. To
 identify areas where technology can help pave a road to progress.

This project is an effort to leverage technology to prevent, detect, and
 remediate bias and misrepresentation in the workplace, products, and society.
 For corporations to succeed, it is critical to have Black representation at
 every level.

This is one of three open source projects underway as part of the [Call for 
Code Emb(race) Spot Challenge](https://github.com/topics/embrace-call-for-code)
 led by contributors from IBM and Red Hat.

## Goal for this project

The desired outcome of this effort is an open source technology solution that 
can have a measurable impact on the problem statements and hills below. That 
solution can then be put to work within IBM and Red Hat, as well as society at 
large.

This repository is expected to evolve into a piece of technology that can
be created and deployed, similar to the steps for other [Call for Code starter
kits](https://github.com/Call-for-Code), such as the kit for [Community 
Cooperation](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Cooperation-2020) 
or [Crisis 
Communications](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Communication-2020).

## Problem statements

1. [Police interactions with the Black community disproportionately end in 
escalation](#problem-statement-1)
2. [Lack of transparent and accurate data available to assess police behavioral
 infractions](#problem-statement-2)
3. [People in the Black Community are faced with harsher downstream 
 effects](#problem-statement-3)

## Problem statement 1

Police interactions with members of the Black community disproportionately end
 in unnecessary and avoidable escalation.

### Hills (who, what, and wow)

1. The public will have access to factual data on police behavioral infractions
 so that police officers can be held publicly accountable for their actions. 
   * Law enforcement agencies can flag officers with behavior infractions that
   remain visible across jurisdictions and can use the infractions as input for
   relevant actions (hiring, firing, remediation, etc.)

2. Law enforcement has technology embedded in their equipment to help
 objectively assess accurate threat level and providesguidance on appropriate
 threat response in real time.

3. Law enforcement agencies have access to free technology which identifies both
 singular incidents and behavioral patterns so that regular data-driven
 evaluations of policing outcomes take place.
   * Law Enforcement agencies and governmental leadership are automatically
   required to respond with actions and remediation based on the evaluation
   reports so that they are held accountable for addressing surfaced issues
   within 14 days.

## Problem statement 2

The lack of transparent and accurate data available to assess police behavioral
 infractions means police reports can be falsified and contain other
 inaccuracies.

### Hills (who, what, and wow)

1. Law enforcement can use technology to automatically screen and expedite
 police reports for inherent biases while flagging incident reports for
 immediate review so that issues/incidents are addressed proactively with
 immediate consequences.
   * Internal affairs and civilians (such as witnesses) can both contribute to
   incident reports, creating a tamper-proof record with all accounts of the
   incident.
   * Third parties can access a free repository of incident reports so that
   police brutality, harassment or other misbehavior can be objectively analyzed
   and trends can be identified.

### How tech can help

* Technology can be used to measure the frequency of police behavioral
 infractions, such as, the unnecessary use of force or other aggressive tactics,
 and other incidents, which disproportionately target the black community. This
 will allow for the identification of any inherent biases that may have been
 associated with an incident. This data can subsequently be used to identify
 malicious police practices and help to improve relationships between the police
 and the communities which they swear to protect and serve.

## Problem statement 3

People in the Black Community are faced with harsher downstream effects
 (charged at higher rates, assigned more significant charges, convicted at
 higher rates, given longer sentences, and denied parole more often) than
 people of other races for similar offenses.

### Hills (who, what, and wow)

1. Judges can be required to use technology that evaluates sentencing criteria
 enabling them to provide equitable sentencing outcomes and mitigate bias in
 the sentencing process.
   * The general public can access standard data repository regarding sentencing
   outcomes so that excessive sentencing can be identified and automatically
   flagged for the appeals process.
