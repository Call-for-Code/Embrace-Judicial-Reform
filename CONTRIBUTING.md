## Creating a GitHub account

In order to open issues, submit pull requests, or edit the wiki you'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join). Whether you use a personal email address or an IBM address, you can then [link it back to your IBM-internal GitHub Enterprise account](https://gh-user-map.dal1a.cirrus.ibm.com/).

## Opening issues

Issues are for suggesting and discussing changes to this solution starter. You don't have to be technical to add your thoughts here. [You can suggest a change, add a view point, or spark a discussion](issues).

## Submitting pull requests

If you have a specific change you want to contribute, whether code or documentation, you can fork this repository and submit a pull request with the concrete change.

## Editing the wiki

You are also free to [provide documentation or notes through the wiki](wiki). The changes there can be merged into this repository directly, or they may serve as outside documentation.

## Examples

### An example of adding an idea or suggestion 

After reading the solution starter documentation in the [README](README.md) file, Ndu notices that the repository doesn't have a link to an important web page on the topic. After discussion the omission on Slack, folks agree that it would be an important and relevant addition to the repo. He then opens a GitHub issue summarizing the web page, and where a link to the web page should be included on the README or other sub pages. 

At that point there are a couple potential ways to get the link included:
* One of the theme team leaders with direct write access to the repository could make the proposed change
* Or, Ndu can fork the repository, make the proposed change in his copy, link to the issue, and send a pull request.
* Or, another person all together can proactively make the pull request on his behalf.
* The theme team leaders can accept the change

### An example of providing working code
Sasha has an idea for a Node-RED flow that gathers data from several datasets on the Internet that have APIs. She writes a Node-RED flow locally or on the IBM Cloud. When she's done, she documents it, creates a demo video, and wants to contribute it to the repository.

At that point there are a couple potential ways to get the code for the Node-RED flow included:
* Sasha can fork the repository, make the proposed change in her copy, link to the issue, and send a pull request.
* Since it might be more complex of a change, there may be discussion about the pull request in GitHub
* The theme team leaders can accept the change, including any changes that result from the discussion
